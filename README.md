# Telemark

A ski jumping game for the browser. Its jump physics is a faithful port of Deluxe Ski Jump 2 (v2.10P, DOS, 2001),
reconstructed from an analysis of the original executable and checked against the original game frame by frame.
Graphics, interface and sound are new, made in the style of the original.

Telemark is a working title.

## Status

As of 2026-10-14: in active development.

- Playable: training mode on the built-in hill and on the 37 original hills, and a replay of the last jump
  (pause, half and quarter speed).
- Not there yet: competitions, saved replays, playing the original's `.rpl` files.
- Playable at <https://telemark.visvaya.workers.dev> since 2026-10-13. The page can be installed and works
  offline after the first visit; every change on the default branch is published there once its checks pass
  (`docs/deployment.md`). Checked by hand on one iPhone and in one desktop browser; not yet on Android.
- Every published change of the game gets a version number, shown in the game and listed under the
  repository's releases.

## Features

- Jump physics, wind, landing and judges' notes identical to DSJ2 v2.10P (deterministic on every device).
- One built-in hill; the 37 hills of the original become available when you load `Dsj.exe` from your own copy
  of the game. The file is read in the browser and kept only there; nothing from the original is distributed.
- Mouse, keyboard and touch controls; optional tilt steering on phones; haptics where supported.
- Pixel graphics with a responsive width, time of day (day, dusk, night) and weather (snow, fog).
- Synthesised sound (Web Audio, no recordings).
- A replay of the last jump, with pause and slow motion.
- Hill records, outfit colours and settings saved locally.
- Installable on a phone's home screen; after the first visit it starts and plays without a network.

## Development

Requirements: Node 24, pnpm 12.

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm dev            # development server
pnpm typecheck
pnpm lint
pnpm format         # rewrite the sources in the project's format (oxfmt)
pnpm check:unused   # unused files, exports and dependencies (knip)
pnpm check:duplicates  # duplicated code (jscpd); src/sim is exempt, the port repeats where the original does
pnpm test
pnpm test:coverage  # the tests with the coverage floor for src/sim, as in CI
pnpm test:browser:edge  # the built game in Microsoft Edge on desktop and phone profiles (Playwright)
pnpm test:browser   # the same in Chromium, Firefox and WebKit, as in CI; needs Playwright's browsers
pnpm test:scripts   # tests of the build, release and deployment scripts
pnpm build          # production build in dist/, with the service worker and the release record
pnpm check:dist     # dist/ holds exactly the build's files, within the size budgets
node scripts/check-doc-links.mjs  # relative links and backticked repository paths in the Markdown files exist
node scripts/serve-dist.mjs  # the build at http://127.0.0.1:4317, served the way the host serves it
pnpm build:single   # the build packed into one HTML file, in dist-single/
```

Tests that compare the port with the original game need its files and recorded traces; without them they are
skipped. See `docs/testing.md`.

## Repository layout

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| `src/sim` | the port of the original physics and jump logic |
| `src/original` | readers for the player's original files |
| `src/game`, `src/render`, `src/audio`, `src/ui` | game session, pixel renderer, sound, React screens |
| `src/storage` | local saves |
| `src/pwa` | service worker registration, offline state, the picture the icons are made of |
| `public` | web manifest, icons, the host's headers file |
| `tools/re` | reverse-engineering tools (disassembler, headless DOS emulator, trace capture) |
| `tools/font` | generator of the Polish letters for the Silkscreen font |
| `scripts` | the release step and service worker, checks of the build and of a deployment, the test server, the single-file build |
| `deploy` | the pinned deployment tool and its configuration |
| `docs` | specifications and guides, see below |

## Documentation

The notes in `docs` are mostly in Polish.

| File | Question it answers |
|---|---|
| `docs/physics-spec.md` | How does the original move the jumper on the inrun, in flight and on landing? |
| `docs/hill-format.md` | Where does the original keep its hills and how are they read? |
| `docs/jumper-figure.md` | How is the jumper drawn from a pose? |
| `docs/replay-format.md` | How are the original `.rpl` replays encoded? |
| `docs/testing.md` | Which tests exist, what do they need and how are they run? |
| `docs/deployment.md` | What is in a release, how does the game work offline and update, how is it deployed and rolled back? |

## Contributing

`master` changes only through pull requests merged by squash; the pull request title follows Conventional Commits
and becomes the commit. CI runs the checks above, including the search for unused code (`pnpm check:unused`)
and for duplicates (`pnpm check:duplicates`), verifies the formatting (`pnpm format:check`) and the links and paths in the documentation
(`node scripts/check-doc-links.mjs`), tests the build scripts
(`pnpm test:scripts`), checks the build output for foreign files and bundle size (`pnpm check:dist`), runs the built game in Chromium,
Firefox and WebKit on desktop, phone and tablet profiles (`pnpm test:browser`), and adds a dependency audit, a secret scan, an audit of its own workflows (actionlint, zizmor) and a check for em
dashes and emoji. On `master`, the same run can then publish the package it has just tested (`docs/deployment.md`).
`git blame` skips the commit that formatted the whole tree after
`git config blame.ignoreRevsFile .git-blame-ignore-revs` (GitHub does so by itself).
Security reports: see `SECURITY.md`.
