/**
 * Measured 2026-10-13: in Microsoft Edge 155 on a laptop and, the same day, in the Chromium, Firefox and WebKit
 * of the browser tests on the CI runner. Chromium gave the same numbers in both places.
 *
 * - Chromium: 4 requests and 127 540 bytes until the first screen (the page, its script, its stylesheet and one
 *   icon); 15 requests and 142 275 bytes until the game is stored, four of them answered 304 without a body,
 *   because the worker asks again for what the page has just fetched and the browser's cache answers.
 * - Firefox: 5 requests (a second icon) and 128 679 bytes; then 16 requests and 142 275 bytes, five answered 304.
 * - WebKit: 4 requests (the manifest instead of an icon) and 126 565 bytes; then 15 requests and 268 840 bytes,
 *   none answered 304. Its cache does not answer the worker, so the page, the manifest, the script and the
 *   stylesheet go out whole a second time: 126 565 bytes more.
 *
 * Measured again 2026-10-15 in Microsoft Edge on the laptop, after the replays (shelf, export to files of the
 * original) had grown the script: Chromium 147 572 bytes until the first screen and 162 317 bytes until the game is
 * stored (145 096 and 159 837 before the last change of that day).
 *
 * Measured again 2026-10-16 in the browser tests on the CI runner, after the jump scene, the font of the screens
 * and tilt steering had grown the script and the stylesheet: Chromium 168 685 bytes until the first screen and
 * 185 229 bytes until the game is stored; Firefox 170 247 bytes until the first screen (its second icon).
 *
 * The byte limits are the Chromium values of 2026-10-16 plus 15%; the count until the game is stored is the
 * Chromium value of 2026-10-13 plus 15%.
