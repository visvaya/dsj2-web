 * The construction. Lengths in metres, angles in degrees.

 * - The inrun starts at `inrunStartXM` with a short flat part behind the start gate, runs straight at the
 *   character's angle and then bends along a parabola into the takeoff angle. The bend's radius grows with the
 *   size of the hill (`inrunCurveRadiusPerKM` times K), because a faster jumper needs a gentler bend for the same
 *   pressure on the skis; the straight part's length is what the search sets.
 * - The takeoff edge sits at `takeoffYM`; the landing hill starts `tableHeightM` below it, in the middle of the
 *   range the geometry rules allow.
 * - The landing hill is the format's tanh curve, `y = cY - A tanh((x - cX) / w)`: its steepest slope is `A / w`,
 *   so `A = w tan(steepness)`. The width `w` is solved so that the landing area (to where the slope is gentler than
 *   the rules' 32 degrees, at `cX + w acosh(sqrt(tan(steepness) / tan 32))`) reaches the character's share of K
 *   past K, and the centre `cX` so that the arc from the takeoff to K is K long with K at the knoll's distance from
 *   the steepest point (`knollKBeforeSteepestShareOfK`, capped at `knollOffsetMaxM` to stay within the rule).
 * - The outrun starts `outrunPastAreaEndM` past the landing area and curves along a parabola to its lowest point
 *   `outrunTransitionM` further on, so the flat end is past the landing area by the sum of the two.
 * - Search: the straight part of the inrun from `inrunLineMinM` to the longest the format and the scene allow; the
 *   oracle's best jump on the calmest seed grows with it, so a bracketing search (false position) finds a length
 *   whose best jump lands between `best.fromKMinM` and `best.fromKMaxM` past K. The oracle starts from the
 *   reference player, so the hills do not change when the trained player does.

 * too alike to a hill of the catalog or one of `options.others` (`checkGeneratedHill`); the style rules and the best jump's
 * range are targets, and the report says whether they were reached.
