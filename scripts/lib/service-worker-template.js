// Service worker of the game: keeps one complete release, so the game starts without a network.
//
// This file is the worker's source. The release step (scripts/write-release.mjs) writes the release into the
// placeholder below and saves the result as sw.js; nothing else is changed.
//
// How a release replaces another:
// - install fetches every file of the release, checks each against its SHA-256 and only then stores them, in a
//   cache of its own. One file that is missing, different or redirected fails the whole install and leaves no
//   part of the release behind; the worker that was active before keeps serving its own release.
// - the new worker then waits. It never takes over a page that an older worker serves (no skipWaiting, no
//   clients.claim): a page always gets its document and its scripts from one release, and a jump is never
//   interrupted. The browser activates the new worker once every window of the game is closed.
// - the release before stays stored until a page of this release starts. The browser may answer one more
//   launch with the page of the outgoing release and switch workers under it; that page then asks this worker
//   for its script, which the server no longer has, and gets it from the release it belongs to.
// - the start page of this release, answered from its own cache, removes the caches of other releases, unless
//   a newer release is being stored or waits for its turn: that cache is the one it will answer from. Only
//   caches with this game's prefix are touched; the player's records and files live in localStorage and
//   IndexedDB, which the worker never reads or writes.
